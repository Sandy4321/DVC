# Digital Volume Correlation
This is the Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) MATLAB code from a research project I started in 2009.  The underlying goal of the project was to uncover .  We used laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) to image our samples under incrementally different, sequential loading states.  T

DVC_Overview.pdf presents an overview of the theory of how the DVC algorithm works.  
DVC_File_Descriptions.pdf provides a more detailed description of the different functions used in the DVC code.  
DVC_Guide.pdf provides users with a practical guide to running the code, walking through the software and post-processing results.
